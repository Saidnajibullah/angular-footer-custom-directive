# AngularFormsProject

## APP_INITIALIZER Project
A mini Angular project that implements the APP_INITIALIZER feature of the Angular framework. This feature allows us to load some inital data required for applicaion sart up. It's specially useful when we use thired party login page to log into our anguar app and we need to make a back-end call before getting into the app. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
